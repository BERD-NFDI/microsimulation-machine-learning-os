Each week you will…\n\nwatch the weekly videos (~60 min),\nreview the assigned readings,\nwork on the (R) assignments,\ndiscuss the material in the weekly online meeting with the instructors from destatis and Statistics Netherlands, and fellow course participants (~60 min).\n\nThe videos and literature of the corresponding unit will be unlocked at least one week before the weekly meeting.\nBasic R knowledge is required. Having some familiarity with the official statistics system as taught in Walter Radermacher’s course “Statistics for the Public Good” can be helpful.\nOnline Meetings\n\nThursday, November 02, 2023, 05:00 PM – 06:00 PM CET\nThursday, November 09, 2023, 05:00 PM – 06:00 PM CET\nThursday, November 16, 2023: NO MEETING\nThursday, November 23, 2023, 05:00 PM – 06:00 PM CET\nThursday, November 30, 2023, 05:00 PM – 06:00 PM CET\n\nPlease revise the Syllabus for more detailed information."
